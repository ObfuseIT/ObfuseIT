- 👋 Hi, I’m @ObfuseIT
- 👀 I’m interested in Administration and User Privacy
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on policy based systems administration and OSS development (emphasis on Data Privacy Regulation and Enterprise Database Compliance). Inversely, a private team will specialize in OSINT requests and data collection.
